# Introduction
This repository is where i put PowerShell scripts I have made, everything here is initially made solely be me (although often with some help from an AI or two).
If you want to use any of these scripts, privately or at a school or work environment, please do, although you should probably have a read through them first and maybe change some values, so they work for you.

If you see any way to improve my scripts, you are free to make a branch and do so, maybe one day I'll combine it into a release.


## From school folder
In this folder you find scripts I made and used at school.

Some of these I made so I could quickly and easily have an ActiveDirectory environment up and running, this was handy since i needed a fresh Windows domain for almost every task. (ADUser-Baum AI.ps1, ADUsers-Baum AI.ps1)
Other scripts are simply notes and some theory crafting scripts that I wrote to waste time.


## Work Rk
These scripts I use to automate or make my job easier or faster.

delete-userProfile.bat and shadow-with-PS.bat need to be accompanied with the PowerShell folder since these .bat files only exist to let me run PowerShell scripts without disabling executionPolicy. You can just download PS-delete_shadow.zip if you want to use scripts in the PowerShell folder since this includes both .ps1 files and .bat files.
"Working on" simply exist for me to bring my scripts with me when i leave work. If you see anything here you're interested in, donâ€™t expect me to be done soon, making PowerShell scripts is not my job, I do it when I get time.
